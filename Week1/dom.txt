DESCRIPTION OF DOM :

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed 
and manipulated. In the DOM specification, the term "document" is used in the broad sense - increasingly, XML is being used as a way of representing many different
kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would traditionally be seen as data rather than as documents. Nevertheless, XML
presents this data as documents, and the DOM may be used to manage this data.

With the Document Object Model, programmers can create and build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. Anything 
found in an HTML or XML document can be accessed, changed, deleted, or added using the Document Object Model, with a few exceptions - in particular, the DOM
interfaces for the internal subset and external subset have not yet been specified.
