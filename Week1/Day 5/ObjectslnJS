Objects in Javascript

In js almost everything is object,
Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Dates are always objects
Maths are always objects
Regular expressions are always objects
Arrays are always objects
Functions are always objects
Objects are always objects

EXCEPT PRIMITIVE  DATATYPE everything is the Object.


Objects are Variables:

var person= "Satyam jagtap";

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

The values are written as key : value pairs.

Object Literals:
This is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Object.
Using an object literal, you both define and create an object in one statement.
An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age:50) inside curly braces {}.
The following example creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:

example:-
var person ={firstname:"satyam",lastname:"jagtap",roll_no:22,age :22 };



Using the JavaScript Keyword "new"

var person = new Object();
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue";
