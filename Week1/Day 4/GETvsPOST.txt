GET vs POST


GET method places the parameters inside the URI while POST method appends the parameters into the body.
GET is essentially used for fetching the information. As against, the purpose of POST method is to update the data.
POST query results cannot be bookmarked whereas GET query results can be bookmarked because it exists in the form of URL.
In GET method the information is visible in the URL which increases vulnerabilities and the risk of hacking. In contrast, the POST method does not show variable in URL and multiple encoding techniques can also be used in it, which make it resilient.
When GET method is used in the form, only ASCII characters are accepted in data types. On the contrary, POST method does not bind form data types and permit binary as well as ASCII characters.
The variable size in GET method is approx 2000 characters. Inversely, POST method allows up to 8 Mb variable size.
GET method data is cacheable while data of POST method is not.
